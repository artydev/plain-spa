## Introduction

This boilerplate uses [Sinuous](https://github.com/luwes/sinuous) (a small, fast, reactive UI library) and [Storeon Router](https://github.com/storeon/storeon) (570 bytes modern router) under the hood. Both libraries are tied together, I'd otherwise reinvent the wheel.

The app includes example routes to show its capabilities.

To drop `npm` itself as a dependency, the packages used have been imported manually into `js/modules/`.
